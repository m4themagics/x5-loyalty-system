# Webapp

The CSR browser client provides authenticated, role-specific workspaces. It needs no SEO, so it stays client-side rendered; the public, SEO-facing surfaces live in the `website` workspace instead. It consumes the same API contracts as mobile and keeps server-state, form-state, auth, and role navigation centralized. Read [../docs/WEB_SURFACES.md](../docs/WEB_SURFACES.md) before adding product-data handoff, carts, checkout, orders, subscriptions, entitlements, or payments.

## Project Surface Status

This section may be updated during first-run bootstrap. Once [CHECKLIST.md](../CHECKLIST.md) reports an install in progress or completed and its _Active surfaces_ section leaves webapp unmarked, add a short note here explaining that browser work is intentionally paused. When the user activates webapp, mark it there, then remove or rewrite that note before starting browser development.

## Commands

```bash
bun run dev
bun run build
bun run typecheck
bun run lint
bun run test
bun run e2e
bun run e2e:ui
bun run ui:info
bun run storybook
bun run storybook:build
```

From the repository root, use `bun run dev:webapp`, `bun run build:webapp`, `bun run typecheck:webapp`, `bun run test:webapp`, `bun run e2e:webapp`, `bun run storybook:webapp`, and `bun run storybook:build:webapp`.

Storybook runs locally on port `6006`. It catalogs every module in `src/components/ui`, reusable
route-independent components such as typography and dashboard composition, plus non-production
examples of common forms, metrics, tables, and data states. Stories use the real global CSS,
theme switcher, fonts, tooltips, and portals, but deliberately exclude routes, auth/API state, and
feature components. The static catalog output is local validation only and is not part of the
production Vite build.

## Env

Create `webapp/.env` when needed:

```bash
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

`VITE_API_URL` is build-time config. In production it must be a concrete backend origin such as `https://api.example.com`; if it changes, redeploy the App Platform Static Site so the built bundle stops using the old URL.

## Deployment

The selected Terraform stack owns production hosting. DigitalOcean creates an App Platform Static Site that builds the wrapper-owned immutable `infra-release/<commit>` branch and uses `index.html` as the SPA catch-all. Yandex builds `webapp/dist` from a `git archive` of the same captured commit and publishes immutable assets before the page shell to an Object Storage website bucket; Cloud CDN is opt-in. Use `bun run release -- <digitalocean|yandex>` and follow [../docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](../docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Practice

Use TanStack Query for server state, TanStack Mutation for API writes, TanStack Form for forms, and shared Zod schemas from `packages/contracts` for validation. The access token lives only in browser memory; refresh uses the HttpOnly cookie set by the backend. One browser Web Lock serializes every cookie-changing auth transition across same-origin tabs. Versioned session events make login, registration, refresh expiry, and logout invalidate stale access tokens and session-scoped caches before another principal can be applied; refresh/retry also compares JWT subjects and never repeats an authenticated operation as a different user. `src/features/auth` is the golden path: its public index exposes the provider, user context, auth UI, and an authenticated transport capability for future product APIs; its API adapter owns auth paths and refresh/retry; and the login, signup, forgot-password, and reset-password forms validate submissions with shared contracts without putting product logic in pages.

Put user-specific TanStack Query keys under the `['session', ...]` prefix. Login, registration, confirmed logout, and auth expiry remove and cancel stale session scope while preserving public caches. Successful account changes notify other same-origin tabs to bootstrap from the winning HttpOnly cookie; confirmed logout and auth expiry clear their in-memory session UI. A failed server logout leaves both the HttpOnly cookie and local authenticated state intact and shows a retryable error instead of pretending the user signed out.

When browser commerce is activated, this workspace owns the only browser checkout. It imports the
public website's untrusted local selection, preserves it across registration/sign-in, returns the
user to a role-safe `/app/checkout`, and asks the backend for an authoritative price/availability
snapshot before starting payment. Provider redirects or wallet sheets may be part of that flow,
but order/payment authority and webhooks stay in the backend. Keep the account minimal: add only
checkout, purchase/subscription status, order history, and settings the product actually needs.
The default branch does not yet contain the cart, checkout route, or browser payment module; the
capability ledger must change before they are implemented.

The route map is intentionally disjoint:

- `/` resolves the current session and redirects guests to `/login`.
- `/login` and `/signup` use the official shadcn `login-02`/`signup-02` two-column Vega composition.
- `/forgot-password` requests generic reset instructions; `/reset-password` consumes the one-time token from the URL fragment and removes it from browser history.
- `user` owns `/app`, `/app/profile`, and `/app/settings`.
- `admin` owns `/admin`, `/admin/users`, and `/admin/settings`.

The auth bootstrap finishes before a workspace shell renders. Guests are returned
to a safe known internal path after login, while an authenticated account that
opens the other role’s zone is redirected to its own home. `WorkspaceShell` owns
the classic shadcn/ui `SidebarProvider`, collapsible desktop sidebar, mobile
sheet, inset/trigger, role-specific menu, account footer, and logout behavior.
Pages only compose their content.

`src/features/users` owns profile API/mutation state and user pages;
`src/features/admin` owns dashboard/list/role API queries and admin pages; and
`src/features/navigation` owns the pure role-to-route map. Profile mutations
update only the current-user query. Role mutations invalidate only admin
dashboard/directory queries; a target user’s revoked session is observed by that
client on its next authenticated request or bootstrap.

Keep raw fetch, base URL handling, and shared error parsing in the endpoint-agnostic `src/platform/api`. Each `src/features/<context>` owns its paths, schemas, queries, and provider. Pages import features only through public `index.ts`; features use platform and UI primitives; platform and `src/components/ui` never import product features. Run `bun run architecture:check` after changing boundaries.

Use shadcn/ui for web interface primitives. Treat `src/components/ui` as official shadcn registry output that can be regenerated as a unit. Keep app-specific composition and wrappers outside that directory: project typography lives at `src/components/typography.tsx`, shared dashboard composition at `src/components/dashboard`, and product panels beside their owning feature state. Import registry primitives through `@/components/ui/*`.

Product components own their surface, padding, radius, internal spacing, typography, responsive behavior, and control sizing. Their public props are semantic data, states, and callbacks—never cosmetic `className` or `style` escape hatches. Pages may arrange closed product components with layout wrappers; only low-level UI and explicit layout primitives accept constrained styling props. Narrow inherited DOM props locally with literal `Pick`/`Omit`, as `DashboardLink` does, and keep product-component props explicit. Avoid one-off global CSS classes for product UI; component-owned visuals use Tailwind utilities and the shadcn theme tokens from `src/index.css`.

Product typography goes through `src/components/typography.tsx`. Use `Typography` for page copy, headings `h1` through `h6`, captions, emphasis, shortcuts, code/kbd text, and screen-reader-only text. The local ESLint policy enforces this in application code while excluding official generated `src/components/ui` files.

The current shadcn configuration is `radix-vega` with the `hugeicons` icon library and CSS variables, as recorded in `components.json`. The registry was refreshed from the official CLI with `npx shadcn@latest add --all -c webapp --overwrite -y`; the auth composition comes from `login-02` and `signup-02`. Generated inputs use the standard Vega `rounded-md` primitive. The authenticated shell keeps real product/API state rather than registry demo data. Do not add community registries or custom generator output unless the product asks for them.

When adding or refreshing shadcn components:

```bash
bun run --cwd webapp ui:info
bun run --cwd webapp ui:add -- <component>
```

Use the local `shadcn` devDependency pinned in `webapp/package.json` and `bun.lock`; do not use `shadcn@latest` for routine refreshes because it can produce registry output that no longer matches this template. If generated files need compatibility fixes for current package versions, keep the edits small and leave app-specific composition outside `src/components/ui`.

## E2E

The Playwright specs form a curated browser portfolio: the auth/profile session
round trip, browser session coordination, role-safe navigation and promotion,
and the avatar storage round trip. Pure validation, state matrices, API rules,
and persistence edge cases stay at their owning contract, unit, or backend
integration boundary. One browser journey may protect several related
capabilities.

The run starts Docker Compose `postgres_test`, applies migrations to
`pyaterochka_game_demo_test`, idempotently seeds the E2E administrator, starts the backend
with `TEST_DATABASE_URL` as its `DATABASE_URL`, starts Vite, and removes the test
database volume after the run by default.

First run:

```bash
docker compose version
docker info
bun run e2e:install
bun run e2e -- auth.spec.ts -g "registers, restores"
```

Use the focused `spec -g "test name"` form for task validation. `bun run e2e`
runs the full browser portfolio for explicit release/audit work or a genuinely
cross-cutting browser change.
