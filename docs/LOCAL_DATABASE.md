# Local PostgreSQL

Use Docker Compose for local PostgreSQL on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Do not ask users to install PostgreSQL natively during first-run setup unless they explicitly choose to manage their own database.

This template currently uses the official `postgres:18-alpine` image. The major version is pinned to PostgreSQL 18 instead of `postgres:latest` so patch updates are easy while unexpected major upgrades do not break local volumes. PostgreSQL 18 is also a schema requirement for this template because Prisma models use database-generated UUIDv7 defaults through the native `uuidv7()` function.

Use explicit `postgresql://user:password@host:port/db?schema=public` URLs for Prisma commands, even on native local installs. Peer-auth style URLs without a user can make Prisma schema-engine commands fail with a generic error instead of a useful connection diagnostic.

## Prerequisites

- Windows: Docker Desktop with the WSL 2 backend enabled.
- macOS: Docker Desktop or another Docker Engine with Compose v2.
- Linux: Docker Engine and the Docker Compose plugin.

Check that Compose is available and the Docker daemon is running:

```bash
docker compose version
docker info
```

Run commands from the repository root.

## If Docker Is Missing

Agents should check `docker compose version` and `docker info` before database or E2E setup. If either command fails, do this:

1. Tell the user that Docker is the local app this template uses to run PostgreSQL. Do not ask them to install native PostgreSQL.
2. Ask them to install/start the right Docker option for their OS:
   - Windows: Docker Desktop with the WSL 2 backend enabled.
   - macOS: Docker Desktop, or another Docker Engine that includes Compose v2.
   - Linux: Docker Engine plus the Docker Compose plugin, with the Docker service running.
3. After installation, rerun `docker compose version` and `docker info`.
4. Continue only after both commands succeed. Then create `backend/.env` and run the start commands below.

If Docker cannot be installed on the machine, local database-backed development and E2E are blocked. Do not silently fall back to a cloud database or a different local PostgreSQL setup.

Create the backend env file:

```bash
# macOS, Linux, or Git Bash on Windows
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
Copy-Item backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

## Start Development Database

Pass the backend-owned env file explicitly because Docker Compose only auto-loads
an env file from the repository root, where this template intentionally keeps no
environment files:

```bash
docker compose --env-file backend/.env pull postgres
docker compose --env-file backend/.env up -d postgres
docker compose --env-file backend/.env ps postgres
docker compose --env-file backend/.env exec postgres pg_isready -U superuser -d pyaterochka_game_demo
```

The development database is:

```text
host: localhost
port: 54329
database: pyaterochka_game_demo
user: superuser
password: superpassword
DATABASE_URL: postgresql://superuser:superpassword@localhost:54329/pyaterochka_game_demo?schema=public
```

Then apply Prisma migrations:

```bash
bun run --cwd backend prisma:deploy
```

Optionally seed the login-ready local administrator and user configured by
`DEV_SEED_ADMIN_*` and `DEV_SEED_USER_*` in `backend/.env`:

```bash
bun run dev:seed
```

This command is local-only: it rejects production mode and non-loopback database
URLs. On the `mobile` branch, the ordinary demo user also receives an active
development entitlement so the mobile app opens its main authenticated surface
without a store purchase. Deployment runs `db:deploy`, not the development seed.

## Optional Port Overrides

If `54329` is already in use, change both `POSTGRES_PORT` and the port inside
`DATABASE_URL` in `backend/.env`, then keep using
`docker compose --env-file backend/.env ...`.

## Test Database

`postgres_test` is reserved for integration, Docker smoke, and Playwright flows:

```bash
docker compose --env-file backend/.env up -d postgres_test
```

Manual default connection:

```text
host: localhost
port: 54330
database: pyaterochka_game_demo_test
user: superuser
password: superpassword
TEST_DATABASE_URL: postgresql://superuser:superpassword@localhost:54330/pyaterochka_game_demo_test?schema=public
```

Automated test runners normally set a repository-derived `POSTGRES_TEST_PORT` and derive `TEST_DATABASE_URL` from it so multiple template checkouts can run in parallel. Set `POSTGRES_TEST_PORT` only when a fixed test database port is required.

The test database name must end with `_test`. Backend integration, Docker smoke, and Playwright E2E refuse non-test database names by default so they do not write to development data.

## Reset Local Data

Stop containers but keep local data:

```bash
docker compose --env-file backend/.env down
```

Delete local PostgreSQL data only when you intentionally want a clean database:

```bash
docker compose --env-file backend/.env down -v
```

PostgreSQL major upgrades are not automatic data migrations. If this template bumps from one PostgreSQL major version to another, either export/import the data manually or delete the local development volumes with `docker compose --env-file backend/.env down -v` when the data is disposable.

### When migrations were rewritten

If `prisma migrate deploy` fails with `P3018` and a message like `type "user_role" already exists`, the database still carries a migration history this repository no longer has - because the history was squashed, or because the database was migrated on the other branch. Prisma also records the failed attempt, so every later run reports `P3009` until it is cleared.

Nothing is wrong with your setup and there is nothing to repair by hand. Local development data is disposable: delete the volumes, then migrate and seed again.

```bash
docker compose --env-file backend/.env down -v
docker compose --env-file backend/.env up -d postgres
bun run --cwd backend prisma:deploy
bun run dev:seed
```

Switching from `mobile` to `master` needs the same reset, for a different reason and with a different symptom: `mobile` adds tables `master`'s schema does not know about, so `prisma migrate deploy` reports nothing to apply while `prisma migrate dev` reports drift. Going `master` -> `mobile` needs nothing, because `mobile`'s history is `master`'s plus one migration.
