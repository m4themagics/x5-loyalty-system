# Backend

The backend owns the API, authentication, integrations, persistence, and server-side business logic. Web and mobile clients rely on the shared data contract in `packages/contracts`.

## Project Surface Status

Deferred for the first demo. Do not add backend behavior or run database-backed setup until `backend` is activated in `CHECKLIST.md`.

## Stack

- Bun
- Hono
- Prisma 7
- PostgreSQL
- Zod
- jose JWT
- TypeScript

## Commands

Run these from the repository root:

```bash
docker compose version
docker info
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
docker compose --env-file backend/.env pull postgres
docker compose --env-file backend/.env up -d postgres
bun run --cwd backend dev
bun run --cwd backend typecheck
bun run --cwd backend test
bun run --cwd backend test:unit
bun run --cwd backend test:integration
bun run --cwd backend test:unit -- src/modules/auth/password-reset-cooldown.test.ts -t "outbox retry"
bun run --cwd backend test:integration -- src/db.integration.test.ts -t "different jobs"
bun run --cwd backend start:api
bun run --cwd backend start:worker
bun run --cwd backend start:scheduler
bun run --cwd backend start:cron -- noop
bun run --cwd backend smoke:docker
bun run --cwd backend prisma:validate
bun run --cwd backend prisma:generate
bun run --cwd backend prisma:migrate
bun run --cwd backend prisma:deploy
bun run --cwd backend prisma:seed
bun run --cwd backend db:deploy
```

On Windows PowerShell, use `Copy-Item backend/.env.example backend/.env` instead of `cp`. Workspace aliases are also available from the repository root: `bun run dev:backend`, `bun run build:backend`, `bun run typecheck:backend`, and `bun run test:backend`.

`test:unit` and `test:integration` accept exact discovered file paths relative to `backend/` plus Bun's `-t` name filter. Without filters they run their complete suites. `bun run test:integration` starts `postgres_test` from `../docker-compose.yml`, applies Prisma migrations to `pyaterochka_game_demo_test`, and runs the selected DB-backed tests. Every managed invocation owns a unique Compose project, so its `finally` cleanup can remove only that run's service, named test volume, and default network, including after a partial startup failure. Set `TEST_KEEP_DOCKER=1` to retain those resources for investigation. If Docker is managed separately, set `TEST_SKIP_DOCKER=1` and `TEST_DATABASE_URL`; the runner requires both and will not touch Docker resources. The test database name must end with `_test` unless `TEST_ALLOW_NON_TEST_DATABASE=1` is set intentionally.

`bun run smoke:docker` builds the backend Docker image, starts it against `postgres_test`, waits for `/health/ready`, and removes only the smoke container it created.

## Env

Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` for local development and pass it to manual Compose commands with `docker compose --env-file backend/.env ...`. The example `DATABASE_URL` matches the Docker Compose `postgres` service documented in [../docs/LOCAL_DATABASE.md](../docs/LOCAL_DATABASE.md): database `pyaterochka_game_demo`, user `superuser`, password `superpassword`, host port `54329`.

The example `TEST_DATABASE_URL` matches the Docker Compose `postgres_test` service: database `pyaterochka_game_demo_test`, user `superuser`, password `superpassword`, manual host port `54330`. Automated runners may replace the port with a repository-derived value so parallel checkouts do not collide.

Keep an explicit username and password in Prisma connection URLs even on local native PostgreSQL installs. Peer-auth style URLs without a user can make Prisma schema-engine commands such as `migrate dev`, `migrate deploy`, and `db push` fail with an unhelpful generic engine error.

`JWT_SECRET` must be at least 32 characters locally. Production accepts the 64-or-more-character hexadecimal output of `openssl rand -hex 32`; do not use the `.env.example` placeholder, repeated characters, or human phrases.

`bun run prisma:seed` (or `bun run dev:seed` from the repository root) is the
explicit local development seed. It requires the paired `DEV_SEED_ADMIN_*` and
`DEV_SEED_USER_*` email/password values from `backend/.env`, creates login-ready
administrator and ordinary-user accounts, and rejects `NODE_ENV=production` and
any non-loopback PostgreSQL URL.

The development seed is idempotent: unchanged passwords preserve their hashes
and active sessions. Replacing a configured credential updates its Argon2id hash
and revokes stale authentication authority. The committed values are public
local defaults and must never be reused in a deployed environment.

Production remains a separate path. `bun run db:deploy` checks migration ownership before Prisma,
applies migrations, removes unsafe PostgreSQL `PUBLIC` privileges for both cloud paths, reconciles a
separate DigitalOcean runtime role back to DML-only access, and optionally bootstraps only the first administrator from paired
`ADMIN_SEED_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_SEED_PASSWORD`, then fails unless at least one
administrator has a password credential. Production bootstrap rejects blank,
known-placeholder, and repeated-pattern passwords in addition to enforcing the
12–128 character limit; it never creates the local demo user.

`COOKIE_SECURE=false` is appropriate for local HTTP; production requires `COOKIE_SECURE=true` with exact HTTPS origins in `CORS_ORIGINS`. Production browser auth uses `SameSite=None; Secure` refresh cookies, so wildcard, empty, HTTP, or path-bearing CORS origins are invalid. Every cookie-backed auth write (`register`, `login`, `refresh`, and `logout`) also requires a trusted `Origin` in production cookie mode.

`WEBAPP_ORIGIN` is the public browser-app origin used to compose transactional links such as password reset. It defaults to the first `CORS_ORIGINS` entry. Email delivery is provider-neutral and built in one place, `createEmailDelivery` in `src/email`, so the API and the `outbox:drain` job share it. `EMAIL_DELIVERY` selects one of four drivers: `disabled`, `console`, `postbox` for Yandex Cloud Postbox, and `resend`. The schema fallback is `disabled` when the variable is absent; the committed `.env.example` intentionally selects `console` so a fresh local checkout can print and follow reset links. Production refuses `console`. With delivery disabled, password-reset requests still return the same generic accepted response and do not create tokens or tasks. The provider groups, the failure classification, and the live suites are in [../docs/EMAIL.md](../docs/EMAIL.md).

Auth and authenticated account-management writes are protected by `AUTH_BODY_LIMIT_BYTES` and a bounded in-process fixed-window limiter. `TRUST_PROXY=false` uses the direct Bun connection address. Behind a trusted proxy, set `TRUST_PROXY=true` together with the provider's authoritative `TRUSTED_PROXY_CLIENT_IP_HEADER`; use `TRUSTED_PROXY_CLIENT_IP_POSITION=last` only when the provider appends the client to a comma-separated chain. DigitalOcean App Platform uses `do-connecting-ip`, while the documented Yandex Serverless Containers path uses the last `X-Forwarded-For` value. The default App Platform shape is one API instance. Before horizontally scaling, move rate-limit state to a shared trusted store or edge/WAF layer.

`REFRESH_TOKEN_TTL_DAYS` is the sliding credential lifetime, while `SESSION_ABSOLUTE_TTL_DAYS` limits the total logical session lifetime. `REFRESH_REUSE_GRACE_SECONDS` tolerates a short concurrent refresh race; replaying the immediately previous credential after that window revokes the logical session. Keep the grace window short (the default is 10 seconds). Run `auth:sessions:cleanup` on a schedule to delete revoked, sliding-expired, and absolute-expired session rows after `SESSION_RETENTION_DAYS` and remove expired password-reset tokens.

Private file storage is on by default and needs no configuration: `PRIVATE_STORAGE_DRIVER=filesystem` stores uploads under `backend/.storage`, so `bun run dev` works with no cloud account and no Docker. Switch to `s3` to develop against the local container (`bun run storage:local:start`) or a real bucket; production refuses the filesystem driver. The full rule set and the upload contract are in [../docs/STORAGE.md](../docs/STORAGE.md).

## Runtime Entrypoints

The backend is one workspace with one Prisma schema and one Dockerfile, but it has separate runtime entrypoints:

- API: `bun run start:api`, backed by `src/index.ts`.
- Jobs: declared once in `src/jobs.ts` and shared by the three runners below. `noop`, `db:ping`, `auth:sessions:cleanup`, `uploads:pending:cleanup`, and `outbox:drain` ship with the template; see [../docs/BACKGROUND_JOBS.md](../docs/BACKGROUND_JOBS.md).
- Cron: `bun run start:cron -- <job>`, backed by `src/cron.ts`. CLI mode runs one job and exits;
  Yandex Terraform starts the same executor in HTTP mode so a failed job returns non-2xx to the
  timer trigger.
- Scheduler: `bun run start:scheduler`, backed by `src/scheduler.ts`. Keeps schedules in the repository instead of a cloud console. `bun run dev` runs it next to the API, so a queued email leaves in development without a second terminal.
- Worker: `bun run start:worker`, backed by `src/worker.ts`. A loop for work that must run more often than once a minute. `src/job-schedules.json` ships the outbox drain every minute, upload cleanup hourly, and auth cleanup daily; `bun run dev` starts that scheduler alongside the API, and Terraform deploys the matching production runner. The loop worker ships empty, so give it a loop before deploying it - a process that exits immediately gets restarted forever.

All entrypoints use `src/runtime.ts` for env loading, Prisma creation, and cleanup, so backend services can be shared without duplicating Prisma schema or database setup.

Primary keys use database-generated UUIDv7 values in PostgreSQL (`@default(dbgenerated("uuidv7()")) @db.Uuid`). Use UUIDv7 consistently for new primary keys and foreign-key references that point at them; do not introduce new `cuid()`, `uuid()`, `serial`, or `bigserial` IDs into this template. PostgreSQL 18+ is required anywhere the backend schema is applied so IDs are generated consistently through Prisma, raw SQL, imports, and future non-Prisma writers.

## Deployment

Production infrastructure is Terraform under [../infra](../infra/README.md). Follow the shared safety and release contract in [../docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](../docs/DEPLOYMENT.md), then the provider runbook selected in `CHECKLIST.md`: [DigitalOcean](../docs/DIGITALOCEAN.md) or [Yandex Cloud](../docs/YANDEX_CLOUD.md). One `bun run release -- <provider>` build uses `backend/Dockerfile`, gates promotion on `db:deploy`, deploys the API and scheduled work, and verifies readiness. Never put a secret in committed tfvars or backend configuration.

When adopting a legacy database, run `bun run db:adopt-owner` first for a read-only public-schema
ownership inventory. The exact confirmation and `-- --apply` sequence lives in
[../docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](../docs/DEPLOYMENT.md); normal deployment never transfers ownership
implicitly.

## Auth API

- `POST /api/auth/register`
- `POST /api/auth/login`
- `POST /api/auth/refresh`
- `GET /api/auth/me`
- `POST /api/auth/logout`
- `POST /api/auth/token/register`
- `POST /api/auth/token/login`
- `POST /api/auth/token/refresh`
- `POST /api/auth/token/logout`
- `POST /api/auth/password-reset/request`
- `POST /api/auth/password-reset/confirm`
- `PATCH /api/users/me`
- `GET /api/admin/dashboard`
- `GET /api/admin/users`
- `PATCH /api/admin/users/:userId/role`
- `GET /openapi.json`
- `GET /health/live`
- `GET /health/ready`

`GET /api/admin/users` has a separate in-memory read budget, keyed by administrator ID and shared across that administrator's sessions and search filters. It defaults to 120 requests per 60 seconds through `ADMIN_USERS_READ_RATE_LIMIT_*` and does not consume the account-mutation budget. The store is process-local; use shared rate-limit state when the API runs in multiple backend processes and global enforcement is required.

Passwords are hashed through `Bun.password` with Argon2id. Access tokens are short-lived JWTs through `jose`. Initial refresh tokens are random; rotated successors are opaque, domain-separated HMAC values derived with the server secret so concurrent uses of the same credential receive the same successor. Only current and immediately previous SHA-256 hashes are stored in the database. Refresh atomically rotates the credential inside the same logical session, so another browser tab's still-valid access token is not revoked. Reuse of the previous credential after the short race-tolerance window revokes that session as potentially compromised.

Password reset uses a random 32-byte, 30-minute token and stores only its SHA-256 hash. With email delivery configured, every request commits one durable `auth:password-reset` task derived from the submitted address before returning the same generic response; account lookup, token creation, and delivery happen later in `outbox:drain`, so the request path does not reveal whether the account exists. The task survives process loss and retries transient failures. A permanent rejection or exhausted retry budget invalidates the undelivered token before the task becomes terminal. Requests are limited to one token per account per minute. A successful confirmation atomically changes the Argon2id password hash, consumes every outstanding reset token, revokes every active session, clears the browser refresh cookie, and does not sign the user in automatically. Reset links place the raw token in the URL fragment so it is not sent in the initial HTTP request or referrer. Scheduled auth cleanup removes expired reset-token rows. The delivery and retry contract lives in [../docs/EMAIL.md](../docs/EMAIL.md) and [../docs/BACKGROUND_JOBS.md](../docs/BACKGROUND_JOBS.md).

Every password registration and new social account is created with role `user`;
clients cannot submit a role. `UserDto` includes the current `user | admin` role,
but access JWTs do not. Authenticated requests load the active session and user
from PostgreSQL, so a role change takes effect without waiting for a token to
expire. All `/api/admin/*` routes apply the same server-side `403 FORBIDDEN`
guard.

The users module owns self-service profile updates, safe admin summaries,
dashboard counts, and role changes. A role change is serialized in PostgreSQL,
cannot demote the acting administrator or leave the system without an
administrator, and revokes every session of the affected user only when the role
actually changes. Role/bootstrap authority changes and existing-account session
issuance share a per-user fence; login re-reads the current user and re-verifies
the password before inserting a session.
Admin list responses expose only `id`, `email`, `displayName`,
`role`, and `createdAt`.

## Architecture

`src/index.ts` only starts the API server. `src/runtime.ts` loads env and creates the Prisma client for API, worker, and cron entrypoints. `src/app.ts` is the composition root. Product contexts live under `src/modules/<context>` and expose only `index.ts` across context boundaries. Auth is the authentication/principal golden path; the separate users context owns profiles, admin directory reads, and role policy. `transport` owns Hono/HTTP, `application` owns use cases and ports, optional `domain` code stays pure, and `infrastructure` owns Prisma and token/password adapters. Route factories capture dependencies in closures; request context contains only the authenticated principal. Run `bun run architecture:check` to enforce these dependency rules. `src/db.ts` normalizes DigitalOcean Managed PostgreSQL URLs that use `sslmode=require` so the Prisma PostgreSQL adapter uses libpq-compatible TLS handling.

The storage service lives in `src/storage` and wraps private S3-compatible storage. Product-specific upload routes should validate ownership and permissions, then delegate object key generation, presigned upload/download URLs, and deletion to that service. Terraform creates a dedicated private media bucket and scoped runtime credentials on either supported cloud.

Prisma migration SQL is not written by hand. Change `prisma/schema.prisma`, then run `bun run prisma:migrate`.
